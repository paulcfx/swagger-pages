Assumptions:
16x increase in data volume by CY32. 6G networks with 1Tbps (1000x faster than your 1Giga top-of-the-line home connection in 2021). Moore's law regarding CPU speed is slowing down - meaning that compute capabilities wont keep up with the volume of data. Edge computing and distributed systems on the raise

As more and more data is produced and consumed there will be a need to use more sophisticated tools to determine whats actionable. Machine Learning on the rise
ETL or ELT process becoming more selective. Data Extraction (the E in ETL) is shifting left to the edge. 
Need for smarter just-in-time processing of streaming data?
More real-time data, including multimedia, which requires streaming capabilities.
